# Real Time Weather Prediction using ANN

This project leverages an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict future temperatures using historical weather data and real-time weather forecasts from the OpenWeatherMap API. It combines machine learning and real-time data processing to provide accurate and actionable weather insights.

## Features
1. Real-Time Data Integration: Fetches real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API.
2. ANN-Based Predictions: Uses a multi-layered ANN model for temperature predictions.
3. Data Preprocessing: Includes data cleaning, normalization, and splitting into training and testing sets.
4. Performance Evaluation: Measures model accuracy using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared (RÂ²).
5. User-Friendly Output: Displays both current weather conditions and predicted future temperatures.

## Technologies Used
1. Python: Programming language.
2. TensorFlow/Keras: For building and training the ANN model.
3. Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
4. NumPy: Numerical computing.
5. Requests: For API requests.
6. Scikit-learn: For data preprocessing and evaluation metrics.

## Future Enhancements
1. Incorporate Additional Weather Parameters: Use more features such as wind direction and precipitation for improved accuracy.
2. web Application Deployment: Build a web-based interface for easier access and visualization.
3. Extended Forecasting: Expand predictions to cover longer timeframes.
